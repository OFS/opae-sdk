/*
  This block is used to breakout the 256 bit streaming ports to and from the write master.
  The information sent through the streaming ports is a bundle of wires and buses so it's
  fairly inconvenient to constantly refer to them by their position amungst the 256 lines.
  This block also provides a layer of abstraction since the descriptor buffers block has
  no clue what format the descriptors are in except that the 'go' bit is written to.  This
  means that using this block you could move descriptor information around without affecting
  the top level dispatcher logic.
  
  
  1.0  06/29/2009 - First version of this block of wires
  
  1.1  02/15/2011 - Added read_early_done_enable to the wire breakout
  
  1.2  11/15/2012 - Added in an additional 32 bits of address for extended descriptors
