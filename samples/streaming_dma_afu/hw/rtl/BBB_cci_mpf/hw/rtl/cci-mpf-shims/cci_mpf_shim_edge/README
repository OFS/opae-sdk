Edge shims are the final components of the primary MPF pipeline at
both the AFU and FIU ends.  The edge provides a number of functions:

- Write data coming from the AFU is written to block RAM and dropped from
  channel 1 TX messages sent through MPF.  The data is restored from the block
  RAM on exit in the FIU edge block.  This greatly reduces the logic
  required for buffering data in the MPF pipeline.

- Multi-line writes are reduced to a single control message by the AFU
  edge, allowing MPF to treat even multi-beat writes as a single flit.
  All flits are restored from the single control flit by MPF's FIU edge.
