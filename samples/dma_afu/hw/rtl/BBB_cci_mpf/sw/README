This tree holds MPF software libraries for controlling MPF shims on FPGAs.

The library build is configured by CMake.  Starting in the directory
holding this README:
    
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    make install

The build directory may be anywhere -- just adjust the path of this sw
source directory passed to CMake.

To select an installation directory other than CMake's default, set
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<dir> on the CMake command line.  The MPF library
and header file installation paths are layed out so they may be embedded
in the standard Intel-provided FPGA library and header file trees.

Set -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug on the CMake command line to emit symbols and
eliminate optimization.

Warning: the CMake "Release" build type causes errors and is not currently
supported.
