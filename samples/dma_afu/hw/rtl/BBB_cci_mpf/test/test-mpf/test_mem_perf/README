test_mem_perf RTL is the basis for several tests.  On the HW side it is a
simple engine that generates sequential read and/or write traffic of varying
buffer sizes, run lengths and offered loads.  Software tests can configure
the hardware for a variety of studies.

sw/test_mem_latency computes a variety of latency vs. bandwidth data points.
Scripts for generating and plotting results are stored in sw/scripts.
The checked-in configuration assumes that test_mem_perf is built in two
configurations: one with and one without MPF's ROB (the MPF SORT_READ_RESPONSES
configuration option).  It is run in the sw directory by:

    < load the version with SORT_READ_RESPONSES enabled >
    ./scripts/run_lat.sh ord
    < load the default version (SORT_READ_RESPONSES disabled) >
    ./scripts/run_lat.sh
    ./scripts/plot_lat.sh

A graph will be stored in bw-lat.pdf.
