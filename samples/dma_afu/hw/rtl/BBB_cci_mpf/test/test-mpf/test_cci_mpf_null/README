test_cci_mpf_null is a CCI-P test.  The AFU uses MPF SystemVerilog interfaces
but the actual MPF shim collection is never instantiated.

The test allocates a collection of 2MB buffers.  The write process streams through
a buffer once, writing a known value to each line.  The known value changes with
each pass through a buffer.  When a buffer is completely written the write
process moves on to the next buffer.

The read process follows the write process, streaming continuously through a
single buffer that is not currently being written.  The read process shifts
buffers at the same time that the write process shifts.  Each read response
value is checked against the expected response.  When a mismatch is detected
the location and expected value are forwarded to the CPU.  The CPU then
checks the actual value in memory and determines whether the value in memory
is correct.  The error is then categorized as either write or read failure.

The CPU is involved only to categorize errors and to control the length
and number of testing passes.  All other data comparison is done on the FPGA.

There are options for 1, 2, 4 or variable size requests (--mcl) and the test
can target either VA, one channel or some channel patterns (--rd-vc /
--wr-vc).  The channel used for signaling errors can also be configured
(--dsm-vc).
