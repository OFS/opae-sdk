/**
 * OPAE C API function return codes
 *
 * Every public API function exported by the OPAE C library will return one of
 * these codes. Usually, FPGA_OK denotes successful completion of the requested
 * operation, while any return code *other* than FPGA_OK indicates an error or
 * other deviation from the expected behavior. Users of the OPAE C API should
 * always check the return codes of the APIs they call, and not use output
 * parameters of functions that did not execute successfully.

 * The fpgaErrStr() function converts error codes into printable messages.
 *
 * OPAE also has a logging mechanism that allows a developer to get more
 * information about why a particular call failed with a specific message. If
 * enabled, any function that returns an error code different from FPGA_OK will
 * also print out a message with further details. This mechanism can be enabled
 * by setting the environment variable `LIBOPAE_LOG` to 1 before running the
 * respective application.
