.SH OVERVIEW
.sp
The OPAE C library (\fIlibopae\-c\fP) is a lightweight user\-space library that
provides abstractions for FPGA resources in a compute environment. The OPAE C library
builds on the driver stack that supports the FPGA device, abstracting
hardware\- and OS\-specific details. It provides access to the underlying FPGA
resources as a set of features available to software programs
running on the host. These features include the acceleration logic
preconfigured on the FPGA and functions to manage and reconfigure
the FPGA. The library enables your applications to
transparently and seamlessly benefit from FPGA\-based acceleration.
.sp

.sp
By providing a unified C API, the library supports different FPGA
integration and deployment models, ranging from single\-node systems with one or
a few FPGA devices to large\-scale FPGA deployments in a data center.
At one end of the spectrum, the API supports a simple application using a PCIe link to reconfigure
the FPGA with different accelerator functions. At the other end of the spectrum, resource
management and orchestration services in a data center can use this API to
discover and select FPGA resources and then allocate them for use by acceleration workloads.
.SH OPAE ROLE
.sp
The OPAE provides a common base layer for a wide range of
applications without sacrificing performance or efficiency. The abstraction layer limits
the details of the FPGA hardware that software applications must handle.
.sp
The OPAE provides consistent interfaces to crucial components of the platform. The  OPAE does not constrain
frameworks and applications by making optimizations with limited applicability. When the OPAE does
provide convenience functions or optimizations, they are optional.
.sp
For example, the OPAE provides an interface to allocate physically contiguous
buffers in system memory that user\-space software and an accelerator can share.
This interface enables the most basic feature set of
allocating and sharing a large page of memory in one API call. However, it
does \fInot\fP provide a malloc()\-like interface backed by a memory pool or slab
allocator. Higher layers of the software stack can make such
domain\-specific optimizations.
.SH INTEL ACCELERATOR STACK HARDWARE TERMINOLOGY
.sp
The following terms define the hardware and hardware processes involved in creating an accelerator function.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
FPGA: \fI\%Field Programmable Gate Array\fP
is a discrete or integrated device connecting to a host CPU via PCIe or other type of interconnects.
.IP \(bu 2
Accelerator Function Unit (AFU): The AFU is the supplied implementation of an accelerator, typically
in HDL. AFUs implement a function such as compression, encryption, or mathematical operations.
The Quartus Prime Pro software synthesizes the RTL logic into a bitstream.
.IP \(bu 2
Accelerator Function (AF): The AF is the compiled binary for an AFU. An AF is a raw binary file (.rbf)
bitstream. A tool (\fIfpgaconf\fP) reconfigures the FPGA using an AF bitstream.
.IP \(bu 2
Reconfiguration: The process of reprogramming the FPGA with a different AF.
.UNINDENT
.SH OPAE SOFTWARE CONCEPTS REFLECTED IN THE C API
.sp
The following OPAE data structures and functions integrate AFUs into the OPAE environment.
The OPAE C API models these data structures and functions. For more information on the object
models refer to the \fI\%Object model\fP section.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Accelerator: An accelerator is an allocable accelerator function implemented in an FPGA.
An accelerator tracks the  \fIownership\fP of an AFU (or part of it) for a process that uses it.
Multiple processes can share an accelerator.
.IP \(bu 2
Device: The OPAE enumerates and models two device types: the FPGA and the AFU.
.IP \(bu 2
Events: Events are asynchronous notifications. The FPGA driver
triggers particular events to indicate error conditions. Accelerator logic can also
define its own events. User applications can choose to be
notified when particular events occur and respond appropriately.
.IP \(bu 2
Shared memory buffers: Software allocates shared memory buffers in user process memory
on the host. Shared memory buffers facilitate data transfers between the user process and the
accelerator that it owns.
.UNINDENT
.SH OPAE LIBRARY
.sp
Linking with this library is straightforward.
Code using the  OPAE library should include the header file \fBfpga.h\fP\&. Taking the GCC
compiler on Linux as an example, here is the simplest compile and link command:
.sp
\fBgcc myprog.c \-I</path/to/fpga.h> \-L</path/to/libopae\-c.so> \-lopae\-c \-luuid \-ljson\-c \-lpthread\fP
.sp
\&.. note::
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
The OPAE library uses the third\-party \(galibuuid\(ga and \(galibjson\-c\(ga libraries that are not distributed with 
the OPAE library. Make sure to install these libraries.

.SH SAMPLE CODE
.sp
The library source includes two code samples. Use these samples
to learn how to call functions in the library. Build and run these samples
to determine if your installation and environment are set up properly.
.sp
Refer to the \fI\%Running the Hello FPGA Example\fP chapter in the \fIIntel® Acceleration Stack
Quick Start Guide for for Intel Programmable Acceleration Card with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA\fP for more information about using the sample code.
.SH HIGH-LEVEL DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

Building and installing the OPAE library results in the following directory structure on the Linux OS.
Windows and MacOS have similar directories and files.

.SH API COMPONENTS
.sp
The API object model abstracts the physical FPGA device and
available functions. It is a generalized model and extends to
describe any FPGA type.
.SS Object Models
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfpga_objtype\fP: An enum type that represents the type of an FPGA resource, either \fBFPGA_DEVICE\fP or \fBFPGA_ACCELERATOR\fP\&.
An \fBFPGA_DEVICE\fP object corresponds to a physical FPGA device. Only \fBFPGA_DEVICE\fP objects can invoke management functions.
The \fBFPGA_ACCELERATOR\fP represents an instance of an AFU.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfpga_token\fP: An opaque type that represents a resource known to, but not
necessarily owned by, the calling process. The calling process must own a
resource before it can invoke functions of the resource.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfpga_handle\fP: An opaque type that represents a resource owned by the
calling process. The API functions \fBfpgaOpen()\fP and \fBfpgaClose()\fP acquire and release ownership of a resource that an \fBfpga_handle\fP represents. (Refer to the \fI\%Functions\fP section for more information.)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfpga_properties\fP: An opaque type for a properties object. Your
applications use these properties to query and search for appropriate resources. The
\fI\%FPGA Resource Properties\fP section documents properties visible to your
applications.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfpga_event_handle\fP: An opaque handle the FPGA driver uses to notify your
application about an event.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfpga_event_type\fP: An enum type that represents the types of events. The following are valid values:
\fBFPGA_EVENT_INTERRUPT\fP, \fBFPGA_EVENT_ERROR\fP, and \fBFPGA_EVENT_POWER_THERMAL\fP\&. (The Intel Programmable Acceleration Card (PAC) with
Intel Arria 10 GX FPGA does not handle thermal and power events.)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfpga_result\fP: An enum type to represent the result of an API function. If the
function returns successfully the result is \fBFPGA_OK\fP\&. Otherwise, the result is
the appropriate error codes. Function \fBfpgaErrStr()\fP translates an error code
into human\-readable strings.

of the requested operation. Any return code other than \fBFPGA_OK\fP indicates an error or unexpected
behavior. When using the OPAE C API, always check the API return codes.

.SH USAGE MODELS
.SS Query and Search for a Resource
.sp
The user\-code first populates an \fBfpga_properties\fP object with the required properties.
Then, \fBfpgaEnumerate()\fP searches for matching resources. \fBfpgaEnumerate()\fP may return more
than one matching resource.

The \fBfpgaEnumerate()\fP function can take multiple \fBfpga_properties\fPobjects in an array. In such cases,
the function performs a logical OR of  the properties object and returns resources that match any of
the multiple properties. The  \fBfpga_token\fP objects that \fBfpgaEnumerate()\fP returns, do not signify
ownership. To acquire ownership of a resource represented by a token, pass the token to \fBfpgaOpen()\fP\&.
.SS Acquire and Release a Resource
.sp
Use \fBfpgaOpen()\fP and \fBfpgaClose()\fP to acquire and release ownership of a resource.
The calling process must own the resource before it can initiate MMIO, access share memory buffers,
and use functions offered by the resource.
