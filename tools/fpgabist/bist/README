The ArriaÂ® 10 DCP BIST is a mechanism designed to allow 
the DCP system to troubleshoot itself and find components 
that are responsible for any failures without modifying 
the blue bit boundary or any external interface.  It is 
intended to reduce test-cycle duration and reduce test 
complexity for new DCP boards or DCP boards that are 
believed to have malfunctioning components.
