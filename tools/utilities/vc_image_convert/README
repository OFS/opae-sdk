This the tool used to generate BIN file for FPGA Image Flash chip pre-programming.


Environment
-----------
Make sure quartus tools are installed and accessible.

Add the tools bin to PATH environment, example:

export PATH=/root/intelFPGA_pro/18.0/nios2eds/bin/gnu/H-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/:/root/intelFPGA_pro/18.0/quartus/bin/:$PATH

or add to startup rc file.


Input Files
-----------
Input files required for BIN file generation includes:

1) input_files/vc_dtb.bin

This is device tree table file. An default vc_dtb.bin copied from vc_max10_dtb_alpha_ww02_3.bin is included. Its location and name can be different, you can use -d option to specify it.

2) input_files/chip.sof

This is SOF file from FPGA release. You can copy a chip.sof file to this folder or just use -u option to specify one to use.


Output Files
------------
Output files could be found in output_files folder.

1) output_files/vcp_a10_flash.bin

This is the origin bin file converted from sof file. Its size is 125763584.

2) output_files/vcp_a10_flash-[current_date].bin

This is the bin file for fpgaflash tool to use. Its name can be changed by using -o option. Its size is 134217728.

3) output_files/vc_reverse.bin

This is the bin file with bit reversed from 1).

4) output_files/vc_flash_reverse.bin

This is the bin file with bit reversed from 2).

Above reverse version could be used for factory image pre-programming.


Instruction
-----------

1) ./sof_convert.sh

This command generate target bin files by using input_files/chip.sof as factory and user image, and using input_files/vc_dtb.bin as device tree table.

2) ./sof_convert.sh -u [a10_sof_file]

This command generate target bin files by using [a10_sof_file] as factory and user image, and using input_files/vc_dtb.bin as device tree table.

3) ./sof_convert.sh -u [a10_sof_file] -d [vc_dtb_file]

This command generate target bin files by using [a10_sof_file] as factory and user image, and using [vc_dtb_file] as device tree table.

4) ./sof_convert.sh --help

This command print the help information.

5) ./fw_convert.sh [nios_bin_file]

This command generate ihex file of NIOS FW for fpgaflash tool.
