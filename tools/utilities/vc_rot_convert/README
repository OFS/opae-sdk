Add the tools bin to PATH environment, example:

export PATH=/root/intelFPGA_pro/18.0/quartus/bin/:$PATH

or add to startup rc file.

Make script files rot_convert.sh executable, example:

chmod +x rot_convert.sh


Input Files
-----------
Input files required for BIN file generation includes:

1) input_files/chip.sof
This is SOF file from FPGA release. You can copy a chip.sof file to this folder or just use -u option to specify one to use.


Output Files
------------
Output files could be found in output_files folder.

output_files/chip_rot.bin
This is the bin file for PACSign tool to use, its name can be changed via -o option.


Instruction
-----------

1) ./rot_convert.sh
This command generate target bin files by using input_files/chip.sof as source image.

2) ./rot_convert.sh -u [user_sof_file] -o [target_bin_file]
This command generate target bin files by using [user_sof_file] as user image.

3) ./rot_convert.sh -h
This command print the help information.
