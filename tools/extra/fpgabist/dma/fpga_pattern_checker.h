Address 0  --> Bits 31:0 are used store the payload length.  This field should only be written to while the checker is stopped.  This field is ignored if the
               infinite length test enable bit is set in the control register.
Address 4  --> Bits 15:0 is used to store pattern length, bits 31:16 used to store a new position in the pattern.  The position will update as the checker is
               operating.
               These fields should only be written to while the checker core is stopped.
Address 8  --> Bit 0 (infinite length test enable)is used to instruct the checker to ignore the payload length field and check the pattern until stopped.
               Bit 1 (checking complete IRQ mask) is the checking complete interrupt mask bit.
               Bit 2 (failure detected IRQ mask) is the checking failure interrupt mask bit.
               Bit 3 (accept only packet data enable) is used to instruct the checker to ignore any data received before SOP and after EOP.
               Bit 4 (stop on failure detection enable) is used to stop the checker when a failure is detected
               Bit 31 (checker enable) is used to start the checker core so that it begins receiving data.  This field must be set at the same time or after all the
                      other fields bits are programmed.  This field must be cleared before modifying other fields.  This field is cleared automatically when checking
                      completes.
Address 12 --> Bit 0 (checker operating) when set the checker is operational.
               Bit 1 (checker complete) is set when the checker completes the test.
               Bit 2 (error detected) is set when the checker detects an error during the test.
               Bit 3 (irq) is set when the IRQ fires, write a 1 to this bit to clear the interrupt
               Bit 4 (error count overflow) when the error counter overflows this bit is set.  This bit is cleared when the checker is started.
               Bits 31:16 (error count) each time an error is detected this counter is incremented.  This counter is cleared when the checker is started.
