Address 0  --> Bits 31:0 are used store the payload length as well as read it back while the generator core is operating.  This field should only be written to while
               the generator is stopped.
Address 4  --> Bits 15:0 is used to store pattern length, bits 31:16 used to store a new position in the pattern.  The position will update as the generator is operating.
               These fields should only be written to while the generator core is stopped.
Address 8  --> Bit 0 (infinite length test enable)is used to instruct the generator to ignore the payload length field and generate the pattern until stopped.
               Bit 1 (generation complete IRQ mask) is the generation complete interrupt mask bit.  This bit is only applicable to length bound pattern generation.
               Bit 2 (sop generation) when set, the generator will output SOP on the first beat of the pattern.
               Bit 3 (eop generation) when set, the generator will output EOP on the last beat of the pattern.  EOP will also be generated if the generator is stopped.
               Bit 31(generator enable) is used to start the generator core so that it begins receiving data.  This field must be set at the same time or after all the
                      other fields bits are programmed.  This field must be cleared before modifying other fields.  This field is cleared automatically when checking
                      completes.
Address 12 --> Bit 0 (generator operating) when set the generator is operational.
               Bit 1 (generator complete) is set when the generator completes generating the pattern.
               Bit 2 (irq) is set when the IRQ fires, write a 1 to this bit to clear the interrupt.
