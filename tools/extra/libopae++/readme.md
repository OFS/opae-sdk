# libopaec++ Deprecation Notice #

libopaec++ is being deprecated in favor of the official OPAE C++ API
While no tools in the OPAE codebase use libopaec++, the code is being kept here
for any other tools that may use it outside of the OPAE repository.
This directory, however, will be removed in future versions of OPAE.

For more information and reference on the official API, see the
[documentation](https://opae.github.io/latest/docs/fpga_api/fpga_cxx_api.html).
