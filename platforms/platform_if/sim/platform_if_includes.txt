##
## Include this file in an ASE build to import platform interface definitions
## into a simulation environment by adding the following line to vlog_files.list
## in an ASE build directory:
##
##     -F <absolute path to this directory>/platform_if_addenda.txt
##
## Note that "-F" must be used and not "-f".  The former uses paths relative
## to this directory.  The latter uses only absolute paths.
