Shims here are invoked by the top-level code that manages the partial reconfiguration
boundary.  Instead of directly instantiating an AFU (e.g. ccip_std_afu), these
intermediate shims will be mapped first.  The shims transform the interface and then
connect to the AFU.

Shims names are defined in the JSON field "platform-shim-module-name" in
AFU top-level interface descriptions: ../../../afu_top_ifc_db/

Shims typically offer automatic clock crossing and automatic platform-specific
register stage insertion to aid in timing closure.  See the various instances of
"clock" and "add-extra-timing-reg-stages" in ../../../platform_db/platform_defaults.json.

Some modules here are sub-shims, instantiated by larger shims.  For example,
platform_shim_ccip() manages only CCI-P clock crossing and register stage insertion.
It is instantiated by platform_shim_ccip_std_afu().
