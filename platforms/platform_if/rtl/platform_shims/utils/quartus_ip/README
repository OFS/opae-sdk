This library is extracted from the generated HDL for a variety of Quartus
components.  The module names are modified to make them unique, replacing
the leading "altera" with "platform_utils".

The SDC files are here instead of in a par directory to keep all the Qsys
code together.

Extracted components include:
  * Qsys Avalon-MM Clock Crossing Bridge
  * Qsys Avalon-MM Pipeline Bridge
