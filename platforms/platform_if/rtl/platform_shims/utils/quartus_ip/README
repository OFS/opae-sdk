This library is extracted from code in Quartus releases using gen_platform_ip.sh
in this directory.  Point the script at a Quartus release and it will do the rest.
The module names are modified to make them unique, replacing the leading "altera"
with "platform_utils".

The SDC files are here instead of in a par directory to keep all the Qsys
code together.

Extracted components include:
  * Qsys Avalon-MM Clock Crossing Bridge
  * Qsys Avalon-MM Pipeline Bridge
